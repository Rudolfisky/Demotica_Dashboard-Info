# FHICT-S3-demotica-dashboard
In this project i am going to make a dashboard.
The dashboard will show the following:
 - Weather
 - indoor temperatures

# Front-end
The front end will be build using the React framework.
One of the main reasons for that i'm also using React for this semester group project.

# Back-end
For the back-end i will be learning my way around Springboot and how to make services.
These services will either comunicate to an opensource weather API or will comunicate with my temp sensors using a MQTT broker.
