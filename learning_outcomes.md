## Web application
For this learning outcome i specifically had to make a *user friendly* and *fullstack application*. so lets lets see what makes my application any of those.

### user friendly
In order to make sure my application was userfriendly, I did a little research. In this research i delved into some dashboard design tips, different dashboard types and went through a multi stage design process. For the desinging process continuously communicated with users in order to keep improving the designs. I did the Process till both I and the userbase were satisfied with the results.<br/>

### fullstack application
In order to fulfill my fullstack needs, I needed to decide what frameworks to use in order build my application. even though i had some experience with Angular(Typescript), I was quickly React would suite my needs. This was preferable because my group project also uses React.<br/>
For the backend I wanted to continue using Microsofts frameworks. But after having a presentation on the possibility's and easy of use for Spring boot I just had to see it for my self. In order to get aquinted with spring boot and the microservice architecture I followed a Java Brains tutorial. not only did this give me a good understanding of the microservice architecture, I also had a good a mount of knowledge to start building my application. later i paired my application up with a MySQL DB for data persistence and viola.<br/>
