As is shown in the diagram, there are about 4 services that are comunicating with eachother to make this app work: the IOT device, the MQTT broker, the Springboot REST service and the React frontend app. I believe I could host everyting (except for the IOT devices for obvious reasons) online. but this raises the following questions: how, where and why?

## What are spring boot application hosting solutions

## What are MQTT hosting solutions

## What is a safe way to port fowrawrd
