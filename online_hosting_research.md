# What parts of this project can i host online, and how can i do it safely.
In this document i am going to to see what it takes to both host parts of my application online as safe as possible.
The image below shows what the current network looks like.
![local network diagram](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/Demotica_Dashboard-Info/blob/main/Media/Demotica_Dashboard-local_network.png)
As is shown in the diagram, there are about 4 services that are comunicating with eachother to make this app work: the IOT device, the MQTT broker, the Springboot REST service and the React frontend app. i believe i could host everyting (except for the IOT device for obvious reasons) online. but this raises the follow questions: how, where and why?

## What are spring boot application hosting solutions

## What are MQTT hosting solutions

## What is a safe way to port fowrawrd
