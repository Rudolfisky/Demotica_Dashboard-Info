# What role does Demotica play in everyday life?
In this researsch, I will unravel the applications Demotica has in day to day life and whether it benifits us and how. even though one could automize nearly everything in ones home, we are only going to be looking at home automation related to dashboards as to remain relevant to the project. I will gather this data using methods from the DOT research framework.<br/>
This research will be structured as follows:
1. Everday life task or set of tasks
2. Way to automize said task
3. Requirements for automation/ integration in project
4. Conclusion
5. Repeat

## Smart devices and my home
Sadly, not all devices support 3rd party integration. A lot of devices have very specific communication requirements like Google assistant, Alexa or IFTTT. There are few devices that have an open API, as opposed to a closed API (S. 2021). This being said, I was able to find ways to interact with many devices that dont have open API's, this coul be done using Home Automation Software. As my source(C. 2021) says

>Home automation, also called a smart home or smart house is a system that has the capabilities to automate routines in your home such as controlling the lights, entertainment systems, appliances and home security devices such as cameras and alarm systems.
The home automation software simply orchestrates all of those devices. You can program your smart home using any of the open source home automation software we have on our list.

Whilst we do don't want to immediately program routines into our home, we do want acces to devices through API calls. And this is where home automazation software comes in. With plenty to chose from(Pelaez, 2019) will without a doubt be able to set up a nice opensource home environment. by connecting devices to our home automation platform, we will have acces to the devices through the platforms opensource API.

## Morning routines 
By executing a quick Google search for "using home automation for you morning routines" one will find many easy and simple ways to automate ones home. (Heinzman, 2019) Gives a few good example's of things to automate and what devices could fill that need. The main subjects for automation are breakfast/morning brew preperation, smart alarms and automated news/media player. (Heinzman, 2019) Also contains some examples of devices that could fill these automation needs, so lets take a look at a few of them and see if we can implement them in our dashboard.
### Breakfast/morning brew preperation

### Smart alarms

### Automated news/media player


## Getting home from work
