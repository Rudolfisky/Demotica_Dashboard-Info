# What role does Demotica play in everyday life.
In this researsch, I will unravel the applications Demotica has in day to day life and whether it benifits us and how. even though one could automize nearly everything in ones home, we are only going to be looking at home automation related to dashboards as to remain relevant to the project. I will gather this data using methods from the DOT research framework.<br/>
This research will be structured as follows:
1. Everday life task
2. Way to automize said task
3. Requirements for automation/ integration in project
4. Conclusion
5. Repeat

The main subjects for automation are breakfast/morning brew preperation, smart alarms and automated news/media player. (Heinzman, 2019) Also contains some examples of devices that could fill these automation needs, so lets take a look at a few of them and see if we can implement them in our dashboard.
